## Odities:

### Experiences & Elements vs Components

I chose to place ThreeJS related components and experiences in the `./src/experiences` and `./src/experiences/elements` folders instead of the `./src/components` folder because all ThreeJS related components are reliant on the `<Canvas>` element. As such it felt necessary to keep ThreeJS components separate and directly next to the experiences which will use them.

## Legalities to look out for:
